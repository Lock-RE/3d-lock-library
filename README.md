# 3D Lock Library 🔐
This is a library storing 3D designs of locks, keys, keyways, key generators, and other lock related things.  
Almost everything is done in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) as the modeling software of choice. 

## Basic Guide
Different locks, keys, are organized in manufacturer specific folders.  
Whether a given measurement is in inches or millimeters is specified next to the measurement.
